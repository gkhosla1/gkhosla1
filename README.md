Hi, my name is Griffin and I am a student at Bentley University studying Data Analytics and Computer Information Systems. 
This GitHub is where I keep various projects that I have worked on over the course of the past few years, both for my courses and just for fun.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at khosla_grif@bentley.edu
